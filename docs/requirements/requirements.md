## 1. FusionXPay Requirements Document

### 1.1 Introduction

- **Project Name:** FusionXPay
    
- **Project Description:**  
    FusionXPay is an enterprise-focused, aggregated payment gateway platform engineered to consolidate multiple payment channels—such as Stripe, PayPal, and other major providers—into a single, efficient, and secure integration point. By providing a unified RESTful API, FusionXPay enables businesses to handle order creation, transaction processing, and callback handling seamlessly, while ensuring robust logging, error management, and high availability in a cloud-native microservices architecture.
    
- **Business Purpose:**  
    FusionXPay addresses the need for enterprises to streamline their payment workflows, reduce integration complexity, and maintain a consistent transaction experience across multiple payment providers. Its design emphasizes reliability, security, transaction traceability, and scalability to support large transaction volumes with minimal downtime.
    

### 1.2 Objectives

- **Primary Objectives:**
    
    1. **Multi-Channel Integration:** Provide a single integration point for multiple payment providers, minimizing development overhead and maintenance.
    2. **End-to-End Transaction Lifecycle:** Cover order creation, payment initiation, asynchronous callback handling, and real-time status updates.
    3. **High Reliability and Scalability:** Ensure minimal latency under heavy loads and incorporate fault tolerance features (e.g., circuit breakers, retry mechanisms).
- **Secondary Objectives:**
    
    1. **Comprehensive Logging & Audit:** Log each transaction step for security audits, troubleshooting, and analytics.
    2. **Robust Security Measures:** Implement secure communication protocols, signature validation, and anti-replay mechanisms.
    3. **Microservices & DevOps Alignment:** Adopt a modular architecture and CI/CD pipelines to facilitate rapid deployment, updates, and scaling.

### 1.3 Scope

- **In-Scope Services and Features:**
    
    - **Order Creation:** A dedicated service to create, validate, and store orders. Includes order ID assignment, payment channel selection, and initial transaction metadata.
    - **Payment Request Processing:** Comprehensive logic for generating, signing, and dispatching payment requests to third-party providers.
    - **Callback Handling:** Secure endpoints to receive and validate asynchronous responses from payment gateways, ensuring accurate and timely order status updates.
    - **Status Management:** A definitive lifecycle (e.g., NEW, PROCESSING, SUCCESS, FAILED) with transactional guarantees for updates.
    - **Logging and Exception Handling:** A uniform framework for recording transaction events, API calls, and system exceptions, enabling quick root-cause analysis.
    - **Documentation & API Specifications:** Clear architectural overviews, endpoint definitions (Swagger/OpenAPI), deployment guides, and user instructions.
    - **CI/CD & Version Control:** Git-based workflows to enable seamless integration, automated testing, and consistent deployments.
- **Out-of-Scope Services (Initial Release):**
    
    - Comprehensive BI/Analytics dashboards.
    - Advanced fraud detection or AI-driven risk scoring.
    - Integration with more payment channels (can be expanded in future phases).

### 1.4 Functional Requirements

1. **Order Creation Module**
    
    - **Endpoint:** `POST /order/create`
    - **Inputs:** Order data (amount, currency, customer ID, payment channel).
    - **Process:** Validate inputs, generate a unique order ID, and persist an order record with status `NEW`.
    - **Output:** Returns a JSON payload confirming successful creation with the assigned order ID.
2. **Payment Request Module**
    
    - **Endpoint:** Internal microservice call or `POST /payment/request` (if exposed).
    - **Process:** Compose request details (merchant key, signature, order info) for the selected provider’s API. Initiate payment and mark order status as `PROCESSING`.
    - **Output:** Logs transaction data and any immediate response from the provider.
3. **Callback Processing Module**
    
    - **Endpoint:** `POST /payment/callback`
    - **Inputs:** Gateway callback parameters (transaction ID, status, timestamp, signature).
    - **Process:** Validate request authenticity (signature, HMAC, or token). Update the order to `SUCCESS` or `FAILED` based on provider response. Ensure idempotency by preventing duplicate updates.
    - **Output:** Returns HTTP 200 with acknowledgment message, or an error if validation fails.
4. **Order Status Management**
    
    - **State Transitions:** `NEW → PROCESSING → SUCCESS/FAILED`
    - **Constraints:** Utilize ACID or distributed transaction patterns to ensure data consistency.
    - **Logging:** Record all state changes, timestamps, and relevant metadata for audit.
5. **Security & Compliance**
    
    - **Signature Verification:** Implement HMAC or token-based checks to confirm request authenticity.
    - **Encryption:** All external calls to providers use HTTPS/TLS. Potential usage of at-rest encryption for sensitive data.
    - **Compliance:** Provide a foundation for future PCI-DSS compliance (as needed).
6. **Logging & Exception Handling**
    
    - **Centralized Logging:** Use frameworks like SLF4J/Logback to capture full request/response cycles, with correlation IDs for multi-service traceability.
    - **Global Exception Handling:** Return standardized error codes/messages, ensuring quick resolution and user-friendly feedback.

### 1.5 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance & Scalability:**
    
    - Aim for sub-second response times in typical scenarios.
    - Horizontal scalability via container orchestration (Docker/Kubernetes) to handle peak loads.
- **Reliability & Fault Tolerance:**
    
    - Implement circuit breakers, retries, and fallback strategies to manage provider downtimes.
    - High availability architecture with no single point of failure.
- **Maintainability & Observability:**
    
    - Modular microservices to simplify development and maintenance.
    - Integrate monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) and distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin) to diagnose system health.
- **Security & Compliance:**
    
    - Strict access controls, including API keys or OAuth.
    - Auditable logs for transactional events, fulfilling compliance requirements.

### 1.6 Use Cases

- **Use Case 1: Create Order**
    
    - **Actor:** Merchant system or external client.
    - **Process:** Submits order details; the system validates, stores, and responds with an order ID.
    - **Outcome:** An order is officially created and marked as `NEW`.
- **Use Case 2: Execute Payment Request**
    
    - **Actor:** Payment Service
    - **Process:** System composes a payment request and sends it to the chosen provider.
    - **Outcome:** Order status transitions to `PROCESSING`, awaiting gateway confirmation.
- **Use Case 3: Handle Payment Callback**
    
    - **Actor:** Payment Gateway
    - **Process:** Gateway issues asynchronous callback; system validates and updates order status to `SUCCESS` or `FAILED`.
    - **Outcome:** Transaction finalization with appropriate logging, user notification, and record updates.

### 1.7 Assumptions & Constraints

- **Assumptions:**
    
    1. Major payment gateways provide stable APIs and sandbox/test environments.
    2. A single region deployment is sufficient for the initial release.
- **Constraints:**
    
    1. Full PCI-DSS compliance is beyond the initial scope but the architecture should facilitate future compliance.
    2. Integration limited to up to two providers initially.
