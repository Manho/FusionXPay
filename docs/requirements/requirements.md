      3. Initiate payment to the provider.
    - **Output:** Logs transaction data and confirms payment initiation.

3. **Callback Processing Module**
    
    - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/payment/callback`
    - **Inputs:** Gateway callback parameters (transaction ID, status, timestamp, signature).
    - **Process:** 
      1. Validate request authenticity (signature, HMAC, or token).
      2. Update payment transaction status.
      3. Send message to Order Service to update order status to `SUCCESS` or `FAILED`.
      4. Send message to Notification Service regarding payment outcome.
    - **Output:** Returns HTTP 200 with acknowledgment message, or an error if validation fails.

4. **Order Status Management**
    
    - **State Transitions:** `NEW → PROCESSING → SUCCESS/FAILED`
    - **Constraints:** Utilize ACID or distributed transaction patterns to ensure data consistency.
    - **Event Subscription:** Listen to payment status messages from the message queue to update order status.
    - **Logging:** Record all state changes, timestamps, and relevant metadata for audit.

5. **Notification Module**
